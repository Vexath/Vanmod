# Vanmod
This project is discontinued in respect to the developers that have requested that no one mod their game. 

Furthermore, it will ***NOT*** work without creating an AI pathing system outside of Unity due to Unity, as far as I know, having no way in which to extend navigation meshes during runtime.  As such, this code is stored merely for posterity and nothing else.
